_Love is kind_. Here we have the second half of one of the most quotable sentences in the entire Bible. Yet, despite its quotability, I&#8217;ll admit I&#8217;ve been struggling this past week to define really what that phrase means. I keep repeating “love is kind, love is kind” in my head and the only thing that comes to mind is “duh!” It seems that love and kindness are ubiquitous; they are mutually inclusive. However, this hasn&#8217;t helped me in understanding this phrase and thus writing this post&#8230;or has it?

**Inseparable.** That is precisely the relationship the words “love” and “kindness” have to one another. Kindness is love and love shows itself _in_ kindness. That&#8217;s where my boasting about how I love ends. So often it&#8217;s easy to think that I&#8217;m showing love to those around me, but the _way_ I&#8217;m conveying that love isn&#8217;t kind. Heck, it&#8217;s not even nice! Without kindness, how can we show love? I&#8217;m not referring to the push-over, yuppie kind of blind ambivalence, but deeply caring kindness.

**Almost doesn&#8217;t count.** This isn&#8217;t horseshoes or hand grenades, so either we&#8217;re being kind or we&#8217;re not. More plainly, we&#8217;re loving or we&#8217;re not here. Friend, I&#8217;m afraid that if you&#8217;re anything like me, then we&#8217;re not loving as much as we convince ourselves we are. It&#8217;s not that we&#8217;re not capable, but because kindness is difficult. Genuine kindness cannot be manufactured like a smile or a particular inflection of the voice. Kindness wells up from the lifespring within our hearts. Kindness isn&#8217;t _from_ us.

**It&#8217;s time to repent.** If the last sentence didn&#8217;t turn you back, then I&#8217;m genuinely glad and excited for you. Perhaps now is the time to see that we have not loved as well as we thought and hoped. Maybe you&#8217;re ready for today to be the day to repent, turn, from the fallen picture we have of love and submit ourselves to a fuller picture of love complete with kindness. Maybe it&#8217;s time not only to _want_ to love deep within, but also to _show_ that love. What do we have to lose?

This isn&#8217;t complicated, friends. It&#8217;s tough, I know, but only because we&#8217;re trying too hard. We have to remember that God is love and love is from God (I John 4:7). Therefore, kindness as an attribute of love must come from God and _only_ God. All there is left for us to do is desire it and ask for it. This gets back to [Monday&#8217;s post](http://waywardjourneyer.com/2012/01/16/unwilling-to-ask/), but we&#8217;ll find when we do desire it, we experience a beautiful symphony of wills as for a brief time our souls sing in tune with the angels. Either we are kind in our love or we&#8217;re not, but it must be both loving _and_ kind. Let&#8217;s not perpetuate the lie any longer and submit at last to this beautiful love. Let us be swept away in the Heavenly and experience Him just a little more. We have nothing to lose. Come on, our world _needs_ a love that is kind.
