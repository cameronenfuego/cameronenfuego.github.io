As this post&#8217;s title alludes, this will be another post on my perceived shortcomings of social media. This has become a hot-button issue for me in the past few weeks simply because _it just keeps coming back_ in conversations every couple days. I will try not to repeat too much from last week, while drawing most of the content by means of going even deeper personally. Here goes nothing.

I firmly believe social media was borne out of a desire to manifest man&#8217;s proclivity toward narcissism on a global scale&#8230;or at least a broader scale. I&#8217;m not saying that social media cannot be used for good; look at John Piper&#8217;s [twitter](http://twitter.com/JohnPiper) account or International Justice Mission&#8217;s [facebook](http://facebook.com/internationaljusticemission) page. However, these are exceptions rather than the norm. Occasionally, I am prompted to change my status on facebook to something biblical or I tweet something promoting a cause in which I believe, but I can&#8217;t say this happens more often than once every blue moon.

I log into facebook (from here on called &#8220;the &#8216;book&#8221;) and it asks me what&#8217;s on my mind. I log into twitter and it asks me &#8220;what&#8217;s happening&#8221;. Sadly, I type to them like I would into an online diary what is on my mind and what&#8217;s happening in my life. Then it gets posted on the internet for all the world to see. _As if my thought or current activity should matter to the internet as a whole_. Slyly, both websites have allowed me to reason away my self-absorption as a harmless status update. I&#8217;m here to say right now that I can feel my ego grow bigger with each press of a button. Every time I hit &#8220;Tweet&#8221; or &#8220;Share&#8221;, I can feel the rebellion against an outward focus rise up like a destructive fire.

I keep the &#8216;book so I can stay some semblance of &#8220;in touch&#8221; with friends from whom I&#8217;m geographically removed. However, I use it so my status updates will come across my friends&#8217; news feed and they will react to what I&#8217;ve just shared. That is not a relationship, it is a one way mirror. However, I&#8217;ve recently become fed up with the &#8216;book and its normally useless nature in my life.

I keep twitter so I can stay in touch with the friends I have that don&#8217;t use the &#8216;book frequently enough for my liking. I use it to increase followers and build a social media domain in collaboration with the &#8216;book. I&#8217;m also fascinated with some of the thoughts that pop into my head and I toss back and forth between me and myself. For those of you keeping score, _yes_, this is just another form of unadulterated _pride_.

Maybe you are more successful at using social media for a positive outcome than I am, but I am truly struggling to see its benefits right now. I&#8217;m not more connected, I&#8217;m really more content with being alone because I&#8217;m &#8220;_connected_&#8220;. I&#8217;m never alone, but even when I&#8217;m with people, I&#8217;m almost as fascinated with the thrilling silence of the internet as I am the ongoing relationships in front of me that I claim to care about most in life.

There you have it. I&#8217;ve gone and spilled the beans and now you know the crux of my hatred (yes, hatred) of social media. I hate social media because I don&#8217;t know how to use it with out abusing it. Perhaps there is someone out there reading this that could give a few pointers, but maybe we all abuse social media in our own ways.
