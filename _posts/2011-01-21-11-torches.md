So this may be a rather cheap way of catching up on my blog posting, but bear with me, please. Alright, I don&#8217;t like top (pick a number) lists (or lists in general) as much as the next person, so the thought of creating my own list was somewhat repulsive to me. However, I do love music and truth be told, was looking for something to give a little extra oomph to 2011. Therefore, I could think of no better way for myself than to make a playlist. The original playlist was about 80 songs long, so I was not running low on choices, however I&#8217;m terrible at objectively paring down lists because of sentimental ties to the various elements. Well, after listening all day at work yesterday, in the car and at the gym, I finally have it. So, without further ado, here is my &#8220;&#8217;11 Torches&#8221; (in no particular order):

1) &#8220;Light Up the Sky&#8221; &#8211; The Afters

2) &#8220;Savior&#8221; &#8211; Andrew Ripp

3) &#8220;Hello Hurricane&#8221; &#8211; Switchfoot

4) &#8220;See the Light&#8221; &#8211; Green Day

5) &#8220;The Cave&#8221; &#8211; Mumford and Sons

6) &#8220;Our Voice Is a Weapon&#8221; &#8211; Andrew Zipf

7) &#8220;Show Goes On&#8221; &#8211; Lupe Fiasco

8) &#8220;I Want Something to Live For&#8221; &#8211; The Rocket Summer

9) &#8220;Blink&#8221; &#8211; Revive

10) &#8220;All of the Lights&#8221; &#8211; Kanye West

11) &#8220;Monster Monster&#8221; &#8211; The Almost

12) &#8220;Ain&#8217;t Killed Me Yet&#8221; &#8211; Eric Church

13) &#8220;Closer to the Edge&#8221; &#8211; 30 Seconds to Mars

14) &#8220;On and On&#8221; &#8211; Chasen

15) &#8220;Won&#8217;t Turn Back&#8221; &#8211; Needtobreathe

16) &#8220;Fed Up&#8221; &#8211; AM Taxi

17) &#8220;Let It Go&#8221; &#8211; Zac Brown Band

18) &#8220;Ready to Start&#8221; &#8211; Arcade Fire

19) &#8220;Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na)&#8221; &#8211; My Chemical Romance

20) &#8220;Lot of Leavin&#8217; Left to Do&#8221; &#8211; Dierks Bentley

Bonus:

21) &#8220;Light Up the Darkness&#8221; &#8211; The Bridge Band

22) &#8220;Wake Us Up&#8221; &#8211; REILLY

I know, this list has a notable case of ADD, but it&#8217;s only as good as its creator. If there are a couple artists you don&#8217;t recognize, don&#8217;t worry, I may not have either up until a couple days ago. So, the bonus was my caving in to the fact that I could not get rid of certain songs because of the tie I have to them, so my list of 20 has 2 &#8220;bonus tracks&#8221;. Please note, there are several great releases of 2010 that I was forced to leave off this list not because of quality, but because they didn&#8217;t fit my theme. Also, if you have any recommendations, please don&#8217;t hesitate to post a reply. On that note, happy listening!
