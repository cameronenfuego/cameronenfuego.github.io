**A journey to love.** That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been on over the past few months. I don&#8217;t know about you, but it&#8217;s been a tremendous growing experience for me. I hope you got something out of the journey as well. For those of you who haven&#8217;t been able to follow along each week, this post is both an explanation of why so much focus on love and recap of what we&#8217;ve discovered love to be. Friend, if you&#8217;re reading this, then thanks for doing so. It&#8217;s because of you that I&#8217;m typing this. It&#8217;s because of you, this blog is growing. Thank you for sticking with me thus far. I&#8217;m looking forward to bigger and better things here in the near future, though I&#8217;m not exactly sure what.

> &#8220;So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.&#8221; &#8211; I Corinthians 13:13

**Why love?** I think the better question in light of this verse is why not? Christianity is a rather simple religion despite what we&#8217;ve come to see and believe. I chose love because it is the main pillar. Love, unconditional, true love, is an attempt at recourse in a faith that has become more of a support group that people have to attend weekly than a way of life. If we want to right this ship off course, then we have to get down to fundamentals. We have to understand our faith on that level, but then live it out everyday. The wise face the same death as the foolish, but those acting in love have never been put to shame.

**Love matters.** I now and I hope we all do have a better idea of what that love is to look like. However, this is all loss if we don&#8217;t put it into action. If we don&#8217;t show love, then it is like holding onto the cure to a deadly disease while our friend/loved one is dying in the next room. If this Christian life is so important to us, then what are we doing about it? Am I off in my conclusion friends? Did we not learn a little? A lot? Is it not time to take others along with us on our _journey to love_?
