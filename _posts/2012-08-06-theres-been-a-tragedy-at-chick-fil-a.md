**There&#8217;s been a tragedy at Chick-fil-A.** What&#8217;s gone on in the news concerning Chick-fil-A, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re more or less aware of, friends. The company gives away millions of dollars a year, but only to Christian charities who are not &#8220;gay friendly&#8221;. Then, the CEO issued statements advocating the Biblical view of the family and everyone in the LGBT community was outraged. But, the ultimate failure in this situation was yet to be seen.

**The issue isn&#8217;t money.** First of all, let the company do what it wants with its money, it&#8217;s not really any business of mine how they donate. Secondly, it&#8217;s an overtly Christian company, so obviously they&#8217;re going to support their Christian worldview. On the other hand, I don&#8217;t see gay businesses supporting Christian charities, so let&#8217;s leave this one alone. On the note of worldview, it was the Christian worldview that hasn&#8217;t been upheld in this scenario, but it was by no fault of Mr. Cathy.

**One response begets another.** Nearly every Chick-fil-A across the country witnessed a massive failure of the Christian worldview August 1. Instead of loving our neighbors, we, the Christian community, flocked to our chicken. We showed love to a corporation, not people. We showed that we are more concerned with our own than reaching those who feel rightly blighted by the Church. In essence, we showed hate to people who need probably most to see love right now. Fail.

**Supporting a brother.** Sure, we were trying to show support for a man of the faith who was under attack. There are ways to do that without spurning or spiting the other side. Besides, it&#8217;s not Chick-fil-A who&#8217;s on the stand, it&#8217;s God. Really, it&#8217;s the Christian faith which people do not trust and given a great opportunity on the national stage, we gave those who needed reassurance more cannon fodder. We accomplished nothing than to push the LGBT community even further away, and forcefully.

So friends, what do we do? We&#8217;ve kicked the dog and expect it to come running back to us. It doesn&#8217;t work that way, especially when in the same breath we claim to uphold loving all. These are people we&#8217;re dealing with; people who need love just as much as we all do. If we&#8217;re going to support Christian businesses and morals, then we have to do so in a Christian way, which is loving our neighbor, _all_ of them. It doesn&#8217;t matter how you start, but let&#8217;s start now. It&#8217;s time to act, because _there&#8217;s been a tragedy at Chick-fil-A_.
