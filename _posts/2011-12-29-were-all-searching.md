_We&#8217;re all searching_. After a long conversation with my father earlier this week, I was reminded of this most essential fact. Many of us don&#8217;t know for _what_, but I think we&#8217;re all aware that on some level we&#8217;re looking for _something_. There is a void in our lives that has to be filled and so we amass friends, money, possessions, power and yet we feel empty. Maybe it&#8217;s because we&#8217;re not searching for some_thing_, but some_one_.

> “There is a God shaped vacuum in the heart of every man which cannot be filled by any created thing, but only by God, the Creator, made known through Jesus” &#8211; Blaise Pascal

**The hole is infinite**. Our longing is a bottomless pit and we can throw as many objects into it as we like, but it never gets any less empty. That being said, the question arises, &#8220;What is infinite?&#8221; The answer to this should provide direction for our search. **God**. We should seek to fill our vacuum, as Pascal called it, with God who is infinite as our longing is. The thing here is, He is the _only_ thing who could ever fill the void as there is nothing else perfectly infinite after which we could strive. Yet, God is invisible and it is hard to see how invisible might fill a very tangible hole.

> &#8220;&#8216;Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.'&#8221; &#8211; Matthew 11:28-30

**We have rest for our souls**. While on the surface it seems Jesus is offering us a break from our jobs, He hints at what He is offering of far greater value here in the phrase &#8220;and you will find rest for your souls.&#8221; Jesus knew thousands of years ago that our souls were never at rest and I would most certainly agree. In response to this, Jesus says that in Him we find the solution for our vacuum. In Him we find the infinite to sate our unending heart longings. We find satisfaction for an otherwise restless soul.

> &#8220;For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.&#8221; &#8211; Hebrews 4:12-13

**We all want to be known**. Scary and ominous as the above passage seems, there is comfort beyond words to be found. I know of no one who can judge my intentions, certainly not with absolute accuracy. I even have trouble myself sometimes. God knows us so well that He, however, _can_ always. He understands with such depth, that nothing we do goes misunderstood or hidden. In front of God, we are free to be completely vulnerable as He knows us more intimately than anyone and still loves us greater than all. Dare I repeat that; He loves us more intimately than _anyone_ and still loves us greater than _all_.

> &#8220;By this we shall know that we are of the truth and reassure our heart before him; for whenever our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and he knows everything.&#8221; &#8211; I John 3:19-20

What are we waiting for? We know that we desperately need something and nothing we&#8217;ve tried yet has filled that longing. I know, because I&#8217;ve wandered through that midnight of the soul. Even at midnight is there a light and He is waiting with outstretched arms to make us whole again. He knows us intimately and loves us passionately if only we&#8217;ll stop running. If we only stop cursing His name, we find He is standing there even still. Through the insults and pain, our Savior waits with baited breath for our call. The only reason we&#8217;ve not found what we&#8217;re looking for is _ourselves_. _We&#8217;re all searching_.
