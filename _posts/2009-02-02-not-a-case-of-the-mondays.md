<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:small;">And it&#8217;s Monday, but not a typical one. Thank the Lord for good moods and His grace. For whatever reason, it probably had something to do with the Bible study prep material that I was doing while working, I was in the best mood leaving work. This Study, strangely and providentially, follows the material of Sunday&#8217;s sermon and subsequent quiet time almost perfectly.</span>
  
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:small;">There is so much about God and the Christian lifestyle that I have gotten so screwed up in my head that it&#8217;s a little scary, honestly. In his book </span><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:small;font-style:italic;">Emotionally Healthy Spirituality</span><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:small;">, Peter Scazzero I think points out something often overlooked, something that I have certainly missed. He points out that the way we view spirituality and God has a lot to do with how we were raised and our family background. I view God in light of always trying to appease my parents, seeking approval and affirmation, therefore I feel that I must &#8220;perform&#8221; to please God. I do not see Him as accepting me regardless and not becoming disappointed in me when I do the wrong thing. I am so afraid to screw up in my spiritual walk that it looks more like an infant&#8217;s crawl. It&#8217;s rather pathetic I will admit. I am so paralyzed by this fear that there is no hope of me espousing the true lifestyle I am called to lead. I am to be loving RECKLESSLY, which I realize carries a negative connotation. However, by reckless I mean that if I am truly filled with the Spirit of the God whom I claim to worship with my whole heart, then by God being love, I should be filled with love and overflowing that showering it on all with whom I come into contact. I don&#8217;t. That really is the long and short of the state of my heart. I keep it guarded as I will admit I&#8217;ve been hurt brutally in the past. I don&#8217;t wish to blame those who hurt me as hurt is a natural part of life that is necessary so that we may learn to love more wisely, but nonetheless as the word suggests it does create pain. I have and continue to put my faith in things that were never meant to have that faith, but there God is on the sidelines, in a sense, where I put Him waiting for me to return to the only true love I have ever known. Sure, my parents love me but the love which comes from them is very different. I can keep secrets from my parents, whereas I cannot do the same with God. There is a part of me that wants to question if my parents would still love me the way they do if they knew all that I had done, but I know that situation does not exist with God, because there is nothing I could even attempt to hide from Him. I have to say that this is an incredibly scary thought, but after reading through that Bible study, I feel like it&#8217;s been pretty well confirmed that He loves me still. What have I done to deserve it? I think the answer to this question is the most reassuring and uplifting in all of life&#8217;s questions. He loved me so much before I was ever conceived that He sent His Son to be a sacrifice so that He could share an eternity with me. I am worth just that much to Him. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I cannot put a price on that.</span>
  
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:small;">Totally unrelated, the Super Bowl last night&#8230;I have to say the better team won, but the Cardinals put up an impressive fight. The commercials for the most part were sub-par. Strange enough, I got more enjoyment from the game than I did the commercials as a whole. Oh, and I&#8217;m not even going to get started on the car commercials&#8230;</span>
  
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:small;">Well, it&#8217;s class time so that would be my queue to leave I guess =/</span>
