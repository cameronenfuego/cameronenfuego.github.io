<div style="font-family:&quot;">
  <span style="font-size:small;">Where is my joy? Where is my devotion? As I write this, scratch that, type this (I have no idea how to correctly type this stream of consciousness, sorry) out into the great blackness that is the blogosphere I should be in bed as I have an exam that I need to be getting up early in order to complete preparation for, yet I feel I need this. I feel as if I am in need of some sort of release of the tension that is my waiting, bracing for the next 48 hours or so. New Testament final at 9, meeting with a professor to determine my final grade in his class, Philosophy 100 review all tomorrow (maybe). Tuesday, meeting with the boss to go over performance and talk about next semester at 7:30 IN THE MORNING!!! Then, I have my philosophy final at 2, oh, and I can&#8217;t forget that I need to complete this stupid robot project for my software development class that has its final run at 9 in the morning. To admit that I&#8217;m stressed would only be affirming the already all too obvious.</span>

<div style="font-family:&quot;">
  <span style="font-size:small;">Who freaking cares? What sort of trial or discomfort is this really providing? Why am I so content with wading in my self-pity and, ugh the word isn&#8217;t coming to me at this time of night. This gloominess is just pathetic and unenjoyable, therefore I&#8217;m done with it. This is just so trivial. So I&#8217;m dealing with a couple days of absolute busyness&#8230;yes, go on.</span>
</div>

<div style="font-family:&quot;">
  <span style="font-size:small;">Rather than complaining, I could be spending that brainpower (I can use all I can muster at this point) and energy and do something at least marginally useful with it, such as devoting it to studying&#8230;hmm, that&#8217;s a brilliant thought. On a lighter note, I&#8217;m listening to &#8220;College Kids&#8221; by Relient K on Pandora, and I&#8217;m apt to agree with nearly every line in the song haha.</span>
</div>

<div style="font-family:&quot;">
  <span style="font-size:small;">So, I bought the &#8220;I Are an Engineer&#8221; shirt the other day and after rereading it for the hundredth time or so, IT&#8217;S COMPLETELY TRUE!!! I&#8217;M UNMISTAKABLY A NERD! Oh, well&#8230;I think this is just one of those &#8220;if the shoe fits&#8221; moments.</span>
</div>

<div style="font-family:&quot;">
  <span style="font-size:small;">I have to admit, I think this whole blogging idea has turned out rather well on my end. I&#8217;m sorry if you&#8217;re reading this drivel as it&#8217;s probably just shy of mindless but take solace in the fact that at least I feel somewhat better as a result =P. I must be tired, because emoticons don&#8217;t happen on this blog. Whatever.</span>
</div>

<div style="font-family:&quot;">
  <span style="font-size:small;">In case you&#8217;re wondering, as if you really are, this post was semi prompted by my mother who after talking to me on the phone sent me an email with this verse:</span>
</div>

<div style="font-family:&quot;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;line-height:normal;">
  <span style="font-size:small;">&#8220;Now may the Lord of peace Himself continually grant you peace in every circumstance.&#8221;</span>
</div>

<div style="font-family:&quot;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;line-height:normal;">
  <span style="font-size:small;">II Thes. 3:16<br /> <br style="font-family:&quot;" /><span style="font-family:&quot;">=) this is a depiction of my face after reading this, because He always does&#8230;when I don&#8217;t slap away His ever-giving hand. And then, I saw the verse of the day, II Chronicles 7:14 and it all confirms my self complaint and the desire to find peace in this tiny little squall that has blown into my life&#8230;it&#8217;s really not the hurricane I made it out to be just a little bit ago.</span><br style="font-family:&quot;" /><br style="font-family:&quot;" /><span style="font-family:&quot;">Peacefully yours,</span><br style="font-family:&quot;" /><span style="font-family:&quot;">Cameron</span><br style="font-family:&quot;" /><br style="font-family:&quot;" /><span style="font-family:&quot;">(that sign off just seemed appropriate in my head)</span><br /> </span>
