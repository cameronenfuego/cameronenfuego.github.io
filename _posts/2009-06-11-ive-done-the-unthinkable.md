<div style="font-family:&quot;">
  <span style="font-size:small;">I&#8217;ve had conversations with people about how ludicrously stupid, self-absorbed and pointless I think it is, yet I today caved and created a Twitter account. I never thought it would come to this, but it most certainly has. I don&#8217;t think this to be a sign of the apocalypse, but it&#8217;s definitely not all that far off haha. I plan on posting much more in the coming day or two, but this will have to suffice for now. Yes, I am alright and no, my head is screwed on no more loosely than at any other time in my life, but today is a new and glorious day even with the drizzle and overcast sky above me. At the moment, I&#8217;m trying to take inventory of all the gifts I&#8217;ve been whelmed by and yet overlook on a daily basis. Forgive me Lord for my shortsightedness. Oh look, the sun&#8217;s come out =)&#8230;</span>
