**Do you know where you&#8217;re going?** The question strong enough to silence a lively lunch discussion, it gave us all pause as we contemplated its weight and possibility. A day later, though the conversation long over and the topic taken gingerly off the table for discussion like a cracked egg, I&#8217;m still contemplating.

**It&#8217;s all about the journey.** We say this, beating it into the ground, but after a week in Europe, I&#8217;m beginning to rediscover the beauty in this clich√©. If life is to be about the destination, then why do we need eighty-some years to reach it? Doesn&#8217;t that mean that the time in between birth and reaching the destination are merely lost, wasted?

**God doesn&#8217;t waste.** This is just not in God&#8217;s character. There isn&#8217;t a blink of an eye or a fluttering of breeze that isn&#8217;t harkening toward His intended purpose. If God finds purpose in the creatures of the forest, then how much more so a life of His favorite creation? No, God doesn&#8217;t waste.

**Wrong turns are inevitable.** We spent two days walking around London in a fog. The moment we&#8217;d gain our bearings, we&#8217;d duck inside the Tube (subway) or some tourist attraction and we were thrown for a loop. It was frustrating, but true of life. We stumbled across more things in being lost than we could have knowing every turn of the way. We ambled countless blocks in the &#8220;wrong direction&#8221;, but always getting to the desired location having experienced more.

**I know where I&#8217;m headed.** What if we get lost? What if we don&#8217;t arrive at our destination? God is no less faithful. He is telling us that He has more in store for us than we&#8217;d planned. He&#8217;s telling us that His ways are higher than ours and we won&#8217;t always understand them. But, He will unfailingly get us there safely and as quickly as He needs to, no sooner.

Maybe the question we should be asking is &#8220;Do you know where you&#8217;re headed?&#8221; Maybe instead of telling God where we&#8217;re going, we should allow Him to tell us. Wrong turns aren&#8217;t a curse, they&#8217;re a blessing. Not reaching our destination, we haven&#8217;t failed, but God has succeeded as He always will. Rather than obsessing over where we&#8217;re going, let&#8217;s be thankful for where He&#8217;s taking us today, right now. Then again, maybe I&#8217;m crazy. _Do you know where you&#8217;re going?_
