_Change the world_. You heard me. Go out and do it. This is something that I have come to realize from reading [Donald Miller&#8217;s blog](http://donmilleris.com/2012/03/13/you-can-change-the-world-what-i-learned-from-pete-carroll/) this past week. I&#8217;m hoping you&#8217;ve read that by this point, otherwise the rest of this post will be me blabbering on in futility. Let&#8217;s face it, each of us has a significant purpose and it&#8217;s up to us to leverage it and milk it for all of God&#8217;s glory that it&#8217;s worth.

> &#8220;If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him. But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind.&#8221; &#8211; James 1:5-6

**You gotta ask.** If we want anything from God, including finding our life&#8217;s purpose, we have to ask for it. It&#8217;s just that simple. However, we don&#8217;t just ask once, but we have to be diligent. We have to be earnest in our desire. If we seek to understand God&#8217;s plan for our lives, He will not disappoint. Friends, we will not be left wanting. Do we know that? Do we believe that with everything in us? Before we can move forward, we must. There is no alternative.

> â€œ&#8217;Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. Or which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!'&#8221; &#8211; Matthew 7:7-11

**We need to know how to receive.** OK, we&#8217;ve established that upon seeking the heart of God, He will provide. But, here&#8217;s the next critical step in this process: _we need to listen_. This is particularly difficult for someone so internally rambunctious as myself. For a culture that is so bent on perpetual busyness and noise, this is nigh impossible. We have to fight everything our culture teaches us here and allow for a break in the hustle and bustle. We have to quiet our hearts and be receptive. Contrary to popular belief, this is just as active as any other action we perform. It&#8217;s merely a more subtle form of action. Yes, listening is active. However, the story doesn&#8217;t stop here.

> &#8220;So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.&#8221; &#8211; I Corinthians 10:31

**Do it now.** My dad has this in his office and I think there is a lot to this phrase, especially in this context. Once we hear from God, we have to get moving. We need to be prepared to make moves and follow where He leads. Guess what, it won&#8217;t be easy.However, if we&#8217;re not ready to follow, then what&#8217;s the purpose in asking the question to begin with? Here&#8217;s the kicker (especially in my case): our action requires perseverance and follow through. We can&#8217;t just start and stop midway through once we can no longer evidently see the progress we&#8217;re making toward our goal. Instead, that is precisely the time to renew our purpose. Can you make that commitment? Once again, we must.

> &#8220;For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing, to one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life.&#8221; &#8211; II Corinthians 2:15-16a

Everyday, the choice is ours. We can choose to believe that God has created us to change the world, or we can continue with the status quo. We can live a life worth living or we can subsist. It begins with our asking. We first have to approach the throne of God with confidence and ask expecting an answer. It continues with actively waiting and listening for His response. It&#8217;s tough because it doesn&#8217;t feel active, but we have to continuously tell ourselves that it in fact is active. Finally, we have to act on our answer. Follow through is key and absolutely necessary if we are to do anything with our lives at all. God made us for great purposes, _so let&#8217;s change the world and now_.
