<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:small;">I am not happy right now&#8230;it&#8217;s 3:00 and I was really looking forward to just sitting back for a few minutes and blogging to my heart&#8217;s content. However, I have a lab in 15 minutes where I have to give a presentation on risk mitigation. Here&#8217;s risk mitigation for you, don&#8217;t make me give this presentation right now and no one gets hurt haha. So, I&#8217;m on my fourth cup of coffee and I&#8217;m fighting exhaustion desperately. The worst part is that I need to get some real work done on this group project today as it&#8217;s crunch time and I don&#8217;t have much time in the end of the week, as in zero Thursday on.</span>
  
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:small;">On the brighter side of things, going through my bible study for this week I realized that I do not question God&#8217;s ability to take care of my needs, but His steadfast devotion to taking care of all my needs. I have allowed my needs to be ignored, forgotten for so long, that I just don&#8217;t trust God to truly care about them all the time, just like anyone else. I humanize Him way too much and He is far greater than a mere mortal of any kind. Boo to me.</span>
  
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:small;">I have the song &#8220;I&#8217;m Not Who I Was&#8221; by Brandon Heath stuck in my head. Time for lab, so I&#8217;ll get to that later I suppose.</span>
