**Changing the world is hard work.** There is a reason why few people throughout history have been able to achieve this. It takes a lot of focus. It takes vigilance, perseverance and resolution. Needless to say, it&#8217;s been a tough week. Tough in the sense that I find myself constantly having to resist apathy. However, it&#8217;s more than apathy. The greatest enemy of a world changer, of men in particular, is passivity. Here is where I struggle mightily.

**Let me sleep in one more minute.** I liken Monday to the day the alarm went off inside me. When I got to work, it was time to awaken and engage the world around me. No, I didn&#8217;t want to. I wanted to sit in my office, let the conversations that would come to me and control my interaction that way. This isn&#8217;t world change. So, I took a few minutes and wandered into a couple conversations. That was my caffeine for the day (I like coffee too much for this to be literal, friends). I felt awake and alive. So, for the rest of the day I intermittently talked with various people around the office.

**A smile.** Tuesday I had a meeting and leaving this meeting, one of my coworkers said, &#8220;I like how you&#8217;re always smiling.&#8221; People notice. When we are engaged, even if only a tad (as in my case) it is evident. And all it takes is a smile. If even I can muster a smile most of the time, I think we all can do the same from time to time. Honestly, what is so heavy that would have us perpetually frowning?

**A thought.** I can&#8217;t imagine Jesus was immune from the struggle to remain focused each day. I find it so easy to go an entire work day without so much as a second thought, let alone a real prayer. This is important, because it&#8217;s through prayer that we ask to be refilled with the Spirit each day and throughout the day. It&#8217;s only through this power that I&#8217;ve noticed a difference this week. It&#8217;s not me. I&#8217;ve seen what I do and it looks nothing like engagement. It&#8217;s passive and apathetic. Jesus, powerful as He was on earth, relied on the Spirit&#8217;s strength. Why shouldn&#8217;t we?

**Our worlds need us.** I&#8217;m going to beat this horse till it&#8217;s six feet in the ground, friends. Our worlds are not ours unless we&#8217;re engaged in them. Otherwise, we are merely audience members to someone else&#8217;s story. My friends, that is hell. That is death. We have been given life and given it to the full. Let&#8217;s live. Let&#8217;s be alive, fully. Let&#8217;s follow the example of Christ and rely completely on the Spirit. Then, let&#8217;s use that empowering to spread joy and love copiously into the world around us. There&#8217;s still a world in great need of change out there, so pop the bubble and maintain consciousness.
